The family\'s situation was particularly critical: the mother was hospitalized with end-stage kidney failure (eGFR only 18), suspected pancreatic cancer, gallbladder issues, and heart weakening. She was hospitalized due to fluid buildup around her heart and stomach. While doctors managed to drain most of the heart fluid, her stomach remained swollen. Due to her kidney leakage, there was concern the fluid would return after discharge. Her condition was fragile, and emotional distress was worsening her health. Dialysis was highly likely, but a kidney transplant was not an option due to diabetes. The father, restricted from stable employment, could only secure occasional odd jobs, making it difficult to cover the mounting medical expenses. Their young daughter was struggling to manage the household alone while her mother remained in the hospital. Despite having a compassionate doctor who reduced costs where possible, the family needed urgent support to cover the medical bills which were expected to exceed RM10,000. Through personal involvement and community support, we helped the family access the critical medical care needed during this challenging time.',
